<h1>CHIROPRACTIC CARE FOR CYCLISTS</h1>

A burning sensation in the shoulders, numbness of the arms and hands, and tightness in the neck are common complaints among both recreational and competitive cyclists. They might be easy to ignore at first, but if they come back again and again they may be related to a serious condition that can seriously interfere with both enjoyment and training progress. Upper and lower back problems are common consequences of regular cycling. Your chiropractic doctor is an expert in this area and can help with these problems. In addition, chiropractic doctors can help prevent injuries and even enhance speed, strength, and efficiency for healthy cyclists. Athletes of all kinds can find help with treatments, rehabilitation, maintenance, and prevention in the hands of a well-trained chiropractic doctor. <a href="https://fountainwellness.ca/chiropractor/">Visit our website</a> for more.

Chiropractic doctors have a unique set of skills to offer cyclists, in addition to their general musculoskeletal expertise. Both specific and general skills are critical to successful treatment of cyclists because cyclists use every part of their bodies: the nerves, the muscles, and the joints. In fact, if a doctor doesn’t address all three of these issues at once, you are likely to continue to have the symptoms, pain, or injury without relief. A chiropractic doctor that specializes in sports medicine will have the most to offer you as a cyclist. He or she will work with adjunct professionals such as sports trainers or <a href="https://fountainwellness.ca/">physical therapists</a>. as needed to address your particular needs. Solutions to problems cyclists experience will likely be multi-dimensional. That is, a combination of adjustments, deep tissue massage, exercises, and stretches will likely be required. For example, if a cyclist is suffering from lower back pain, it’s possible the chiropractic doctor may determine that it is due to hip rotation for example. An adjustment of the sacroiliac joints will be quite helpful, but appropriate stretching and strengthening exercises will also be needed to address the weakness and tightness in the muscles that affect the hip joints.  

Strengthening exercises will contribute stability to the joint, while stretching will help to lengthen the muscles in the region thus preventing them from contracting when stressed. In fact, it is absolutely essential that patients do their part to contribute to their recovery from cycling injuries or pain. The chiropractic doctor can treat by performing an adjustment, but if you do not complete the required stretching and strengthening exercises prescribed at home, you may not see the relief you expect. Finally, a chiropractic doctor that specializes in sports medicine will likely be able to help you professionally fit your bicycle so that it causes the least strain on your body. Seat placement, bicycle size, handlebar height, and cycling posture all have a significant impact on both performance and stress on the body. Because each individual case is different, the appropriate chiropractic treatment is unique to each patient and is directed at the primary dysfunctions detected during the chiropractic exam. However, chiropractors commonly employ different treatments often including: gentle relaxing manipulation often followed by muscle relaxation and/or gentle stimulation and various exercises. 

The primary treatment for joint dysfunction, relaxing spinal manipulation involves the chiropractor gently moving the involved joint into the direction in which it is restricted. Also known as a chiropractic adjustment, spinal manipulation may involve the application of a short thrust in that direction. In many cases, instead of a thrust, a slow relaxing mobilizing movement is used. This can be done for any joint in the body. Although their main method of treatment is spinal manipulation, many chiropractic doctors also use other therapies to treat their patients.  

<h2>The following is a brief description of some of the most common therapies chiropractic doctors offer.</h2>

<li>Muscle relaxation and/or stimulation consist of gentle stretches to the muscle that has excessive tension or repeated contractions of the muscle that is inhibited may also be used. If the muscle is very tight, a more vigorous stretch may be applied by the chiropractor.</li>
<li>Gentle finger pressure techniques may be applied to trigger points to relieve the pain associated with the tight muscles. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy">Cryotherapy</a> is also often used.</li>
<li>Gel ice packs are wrapped in towels and applied to the affected area. This helps reduce swelling and pain and helps with pain control.</li>
<br></br>
These ice packs are often placed over massaging pads at the same time. Chiropractic doctors commonly prescribe specific strengthening exercises for their patients with back, neck, and extremity problems. These exercises can decrease pain, prevent muscle deterioration, promote joint health, increase strength, stability and range of motion, and protect against new or recurring injuries. Your chiropractic doctor will show you how to do the exercises and supervise you until you are comfortable doing them on your own. It’s important to keep up with your exercises as prescribed (similarly to drug prescriptions). Studies show that individuals who follow their exercise instructions heal faster than those who do not.  

Following an injury, therapeutic stretching is an important way to prevent scar tissue from forming. Even after the injury has healed, maintaining a regular stretching program helps keep tissues flexible, increases mobility, and protects you from new injuries. As with exercise, your chiropractic doctor will instruct you on proper stretching techniques and will supervise you until you are comfortable enough to do them on your own. Many chiropractic doctors use traction, in which traction devices are applied to distract specific areas of the spine. This treatment helps separate the vertebrae resulting in disc decompression, reduced nerve root pressure, and decreased pain.  

This can be done in the neck (cervical spine) or the low back (lumbar spine). There are still many people who do not understand all the benefits that a chiropractic doctor can provide or how they can actually help you to improve your overall health. For those who want to become informed about what chiropractic evaluation and treatment can do for you, here are some of the most important benefits you can receive from a Doctor of Chiropractic.

This is because the treatment that a chiropractor does directly affects the central nervous system which in turn dictates how your entire body functions. Helps to Manage Pain. Chiropractic care can also help you to manage your pain by helping to locate and correct serious nervous system stress, strengthen your muscles surrounding your skeletal system and advise you on the proper care of your body.

The fewer drugs you take the less dangers await you down the road.
