<h1>CHIROPRACTOR EDMONTON- RELIEVES YOU FROM A VARIETY OF PAINS AND ACHES</h1>

In a car accident, have you been involved? If so, you may be like many people who experience whiplash. The result of a rapid forward and/or backward motion of the neck during an accident or trauma is whiplash which is an injury of the neck. In the neck, this can cause damage to the joints and ligaments of the spinal region. Even there can be damage in the intervertebral discs. <a href="https://fountainwellness.ca/">Visit our website</a> for more. 

Besides causing microscopic hemorrhage in those tissues, this causes tissue swelling and inflammation. In restriction or fixation of the spinal joints, the response of the nervous system to trauma, and the injury to deeper tissue of the spine can result. One can experience many symptoms because of this trauma, such as: headaches, neck pain, soreness in neck muscles or spasms, shoulder pain, dizziness, muscle soreness, decreased range of neck motion, blurred vision, tingling in hands and arms and numbness. Whiplash is under-diagnosed many times. 

<h2>What are the most common types of pain that chiropractic therapy may help with?</h2>

Back pain, neck discomfort, and headaches are the most frequent problems that chiropractors treat. Manipulation therapy is a viable choice for many of these issues, according to the best current research. Manipulative therapy may be useful in the treatment of a range of disorders affecting the legs.

Also, with anti-inflammatories and pain medication, whiplash is often treated. However, only the symptoms are masked by these medications. In patients with whiplash, chiropractic care is a treatment that has gotten extremely positive results. On a complete picture of the mechanism of this injury, a chiropractic approach focuses. To first mobilize the restricted spinal joints and then initiating spinal adjustments, the <a href="https://fountainwellness.ca/chiropractor/"> chiropractic therapy</a> is focused. Non-force and flexion-distraction techniques are included in the chiropractic treatment.

 <h2>Do chiropractors cure pain or correct subluxations?</h2>
 
Chiropractic manipulation performed by a licensed professional is one of the most effective techniques to treat subluxations. These professionals will examine your situation and recommend the best course of therapy after taking note of your symptoms and any functional challenges you may be experiencing. 
 
Basically, the main portion of the spine that is given attention when treating a whiplash, are the spinal joints. Extra care should be observed when doing the treatment since spinal manipulation means adjusting the spine. Therefore, until the muscles get stabilized before performing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_adjustment">chiropractic adjustment</a>, the Fountain Wellness chiropractor will wait. The chiropractor will also deal with how to reduce the inflammation using methods like ultrasound, gentle stretching and manual therapies like muscle stimulation therapy, in addition to waiting for the muscle to stabilize. By means of cold packs or cold treatments is another method to reduce the inflammation used by Chiropractor Delta.  
 
As it helps to increase circulation to the muscles, massage therapy is also utilized, which facilitates healing, and to relax those tightened muscles, it also helps. In order to make the spinal joints go back to their functional movements that have been restricted due to whiplash, once the inflammation starts to disappear, the <a href="https://g.page/fountain_wellness">chiropractor</a> will use gentle spinal manipulation. In some patients, important to treat whiplash are non-thrusting and non-forceful methods.
